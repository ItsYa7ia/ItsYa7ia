## Hey there 🙋‍♂️

🌊 Yahia — The Alexandrian Alchemist  
Turning caffeine into code and electricity into (hopefully not too much) smoke.

🛠 The "I Can Fix That" Starter Pack  
Origin: Born and raised in Alexandria. Yes, the sea air helps me debug. No, it does not help my electronics from rusting. 🦀

The Lab: I live in VS Code on Windows. If my PC isn't open, my toolbox probably is.

The Hardware Side: I build electronics projects. It’s all fun and games until I accidentally touch a hot capacitor. ⚡️

💻 The Scripting Struggles:
- Python — my “let’s get it done in 5 minutes” language.
- GDScript — Godot believer. Making games is my therapy (and also the cause of my stress).
- C++ — currently "learning" (translation: I stare at segmentation faults and cry).

🍕 Vital Stats:
- Anime: primary fuel source.
- Chess: improving — around 140 Elo (give or take).
- Logic: 90% Stack Overflow, 10% “have you tried turning it off and on again?”
