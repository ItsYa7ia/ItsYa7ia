## Hey there 🙋‍♂️

🌊 Yahia: The Alexandrian Alchemist  
Turning caffeine into code and electricity into smoke (hopefully not too much smoke).

🛠 The "I Can Fix That" Starter Pack  
Origin: Born and raised in Alexandria. Yes, the sea air helps me debug. No, it does not help my electronics from rusting. 🦀

The Lab: I live in VS Code on Windows. If my PC isn't open, my toolbox is.

The Hardware Side: I build electronics projects. It’s all fun and games until I accidentally touch a hot capacitor. ⚡️

💻 The Scripting Struggles:
- Python: My "let’s get it done in 5 minutes" language.
- GDScript: Because I’m a Godot believer. Making games is my therapy (and the cause of my stress).
- C++: Currently "Learning" it — which is just a fancy way of saying I spend a lot of time staring at Segmentation Fault and crying. 😭

🍕 Vital Stats:
- Anime: My primary fuel source. I’ve considered building a real-life ODM gear from Attack on Titan (budget disagrees).
- Logic: 90% Stack Overflow, 10% "Let me try turning it off and on again."
